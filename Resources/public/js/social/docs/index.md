### Adaptation of messages of social-dynamic

This app is copied from [https://bitbucket.org/antweb/social-dinamic]. We eliminated all modules excepte the messages. We also removed all logic related to change the browser url (because of problems of navigation) and all Google Analitics realated code.

We added internationalisation, see next section.
